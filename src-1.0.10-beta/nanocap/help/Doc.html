<p>NanoCap provides both libraries and a standalone application for the construction of capped nanotubes of arbitrarily chirality and fullerenes of any radius. Structures are generated by constructing a set of optimal dual graph topologies which are subsequently optimised using a carbon interatomic potential. Combining this approach with a GUI featuring 3D rendering capabilities allows for the rapid inspection of physically sensible structures which can be used as input for molecular simulation.</p>
<p>The NanoCap source and builds for different platforms can be found at:</p>
<p><a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/nanocap/"><code>http://sourceforge.net/projects/nanocap/</code></a></p>
<p>The NanoCap documentation is outlined in the following sections:</p>

<h1 id="installation">Installation</h1>
<p>There are three approaches to using NanoCap:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>As a standalone application.</p></li>
<li><p>From source without rendering/GUI capabilities</p></li>
<li><p>From source with rendering/GUI capabilities</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The installation procedures involved in each of the options above vary with increasing complexity yet this is balanced with an increase in versatility. For example, NanoCap compiled from source with with rendering and GUI capabilities can be used in parallelised code to produce and visualise multiple structures.</p>
<h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>
<ol>
<li><p>As a standalone application.</p>
<p>NanoCap is built into a DMG for OSX and a .EXE for Windows. The required libraries list below are bundled but not modified in line with the associated licenses.</p>

</ol>
<h2 id="installing-from-source">Installing from source</h2>
<p>After obtaining and installing the previously outlined requirements, NanoCap can be installed from source in the typically fashion:</p>
<h1 id="fullerenes">Fullerenes</h1>
<h1 id="nanotubes">Nanotubes</h1>
<p>Although NanoCap was designed to produce fullerenes and cap nanotubes, isolated nanotubes can be constructed. These can be either finite in length or periodic along the axial direction.</p>
<p>A nanotube is constructed via:</p>
<p><em>File–<img style="vertical-align:middle" src="http://chart.apis.google.com/chart?cht=tx&amp;chl=%3E" alt="&gt;" title="&gt;" />New Structure–<img style="vertical-align:middle" src="http://chart.apis.google.com/chart?cht=tx&amp;chl=%3E" alt="&gt;" title="&gt;" />Single Structure</em></p>
<p>them click <em>Nanotube</em> from the popup menu.</p>
<h2 id="finite-tubes">Finite tubes</h2>
<p>Finite tubes are simply constructed as close to the user defined length as possible. This length is defined in the <strong>Calculations–<img style="vertical-align:middle" src="http://chart.apis.google.com/chart?cht=tx&amp;chl=%3E" alt="&gt;" title="&gt;" />Input</strong> options.</p>
<h2 id="periodic-tubes">Periodic tubes</h2>
<p>Periodic tubes are constructed using a user defined number of unit cells in the <em>z</em> direction. The number of unit cells can also be found in the <strong>Calculations–<img style="vertical-align:middle" src="http://chart.apis.google.com/chart?cht=tx&amp;chl=%3E" alt="&gt;" title="&gt;" />Input</strong> options.</p>
<p>The nanotube will be associated with a <em>periodic length</em> which can be found in the <strong>Information</strong> options tab. This will be required by simulation software if the nanotube is to be used in a periodic simulation.</p>
<h1 id="capped-nanotubes">Capped Nanotubes</h1>
<h1 id="force-fields">Force Fields</h1>
<p>NanoCap implements force fields for the optimisation of the both the dual lattices and carbon lattices of each structure. When a structure is saved information relating to the force field is also stored. This allows the same topologies to be optimised by various force fields. Outlined in the next sections are the force fields currently available in NanoCap.</p>
<h2 id="dual-lattice-force-fields">Dual Lattice Force Fields</h2>
<p>Currently, only one force field is implemented to optimise a structure’s dual lattice - labelled: <em>The Thomson Problem</em>. The total energy of a system of <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="http://chart.apis.google.com/chart?cht=tx&amp;chl=N_D" alt="N_D" title="N_D" /> dual lattice points is given by the sum of pair interaction energies:</p>
<p><img style="vertical-align:middle" src="http://chart.apis.google.com/chart?cht=tx&amp;chl=%20%5Cdisplaystyle%20%5Cphi%20%3D%20%5Csum_%7Bi%3D1%7D%5E%7BN_%7BD%7D%7D%5Csum_%7Bj%3Di%2B1%7D%5E%7BN_%7BD%7D%7D%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B%7C%20%7B%5Cboldsymbol%7B%5Cmathrm%7Br_i%7D%7D%7D-%7B%5Cboldsymbol%7B%5Cmathrm%7Br_j%7D%7D%7D%7C%20%7D%20" alt=" \displaystyle \phi = \sum_{i=1}^{N_{D}}\sum_{j=i+1}^{N_{D}}\frac{1}{| {\boldsymbol{\mathrm{r_i}}}-{\boldsymbol{\mathrm{r_j}}}| } " title=" \displaystyle \phi = \sum_{i=1}^{N_{D}}\sum_{j=i+1}^{N_{D}}\frac{1}{| {\boldsymbol{\mathrm{r_i}}}-{\boldsymbol{\mathrm{r_j}}}| } " /></p>
<h2 id="carbon-lattice-force-fields">Carbon Lattice Force Fields</h2>
<p>Be default, when a carbon lattice is constructed a carbon force field is not used and the structure is simply a result of the triangulated dual lattice. This generates a topology of unit radius (cylindrical if a capped nanotube) and as such is labelled the <strong>unit radius topology</strong></p>
<p>The simplest force field that produces a carbon structure of physical dimensions is the <strong>scaled topology</strong> force field. This forcefield uses the ideal C-C bond length of 1.421 Å  to optimise the carbon lattice. The fictitious <em>energy</em> is given by the sum of squares deviation from this ideal bond length. This force field only does return derivatives and as such can only be used with the <strong>MC</strong> or <strong>SIMPLEX</strong> optimisers.</p>
<h1 id="optimisation">Optimisation</h1>
<h1 id="scientific-publications">Scientific Publications</h1>
<p>There are two papers associated with the theory and implementation of NanoCap. If NanoCap is used in your work, please cite the following:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Generalized method for constructing the atomic coordinates of nanotube caps</strong> M. Robinson, I. Suarez-Martinez, and N. A. Marks <em>Phys. Rev. B 87, 155430</em></p>
<p>Abstract:</p>
<p>A practical numerical method for the rapid construction of nanotube caps is proposed. Founded upon the notion of lattice duality, the algorithm considers the face dual representation of a given nanotube which is used to solve an energy minimization problem analogous to The Thomson Problem. Not only does this produce caps for nanotubes of arbitrary chirality, but the caps generated will be physically sensible and in most cases the lowest energy structure. To demonstrate the applicability of the technique, caps of the (5,5) and the (10,0) nanotubes are investigated by means of density-functional tight binding (DFTB). The calculation of cap energies highlights the ability of the algorithm to produce lowest energy caps. Due to the preferential construction of spherical caps, the technique is particularly well suited for the construction of capped multiwall nanotubes (MWNTs). To validate this proposal and the overall robustness of the algorithm, a MWNT is constructed containing the chiralities (9,2)@(15,6)@(16,16). The algorithm presented paves the way for future computational investigations into the physics and chemistry of capped nanotubes.</p>
