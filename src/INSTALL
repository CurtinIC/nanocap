======

The NanoCap source is a combination of Python and C extensions. The C extensions are
built and installed automatically when the setup script is ran (see below). The only
required modifications to the setup.py file relate to extension libraries located in the
nanocap/ext directory. The make files and names of the compiled .so need to be entered 
into the setup.py file in the following places:

NON_C_EXTS = []
EXTENSION_MAKEFILES = []

NanoCap is bundled with the EDIP extension and thus, the setup.py file looks like this:

NON_C_EXTS = [os.path.join(PACKAGE,'ext','edip','edip.so'),]
EXTENSION_MAKEFILES = [os.path.join(PACKAGE,'ext','edip','Makefile.pythonlib'),]


Once the extensions libraries makefiles and resultant .so libs are entered into the setup.py
script, the NanoCap source can be installed in typical Python fashion:

python setup.py build
python setup.py install


Requirements
============

NanoCap requires the following libraries

NumPY 
SciPY

The GUI enabled version requires:

Qt + PySide
VTK



OSX
---
Numpy and Scipy can be installed using the python package manager PyPi or easy_install:

pip install numpy
pip install scipy

The easiest way to use PyCan from source on OSX is to install the above libs using Homebrew:

http://www.brew.sh/

The following formula are avaibable:

brew install python --universal
brew install qt --developer -v
brew install pyside
brew install --python --qt vtk

Linux
-----
Numpy and Scipy can be installed using the python package manager PyPi or easy_install:

pip install numpy
pip install scipy

The following apt-get packages are available on Unbuntu:


Windows
-------

Using PythonXY, https://code.google.com/p/pythonxy/. NanoCap can be used from source on most
windows machines.
