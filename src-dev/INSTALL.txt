Source
------

The NanoCap source is a combination of Python with C and Fortran extensions. The extensions are
made automatically with configure shell scripts produced using autoconf. These scripts are
ran automatically to produce make files which are then used to build the associated
shared libraries.   

The NanoCap source can be built and installed in the typical Python fashion:

python setup.py build
python setup.py install

The build will compile the extensions in a temporary build directory before python installs 
nanocap into the site-packages directory.

Requirements
------------

NanoCap as a library with no GUI.
---------------------------------

* NumPy - >= Version 1.6.2
* Scipy - >= Version 0.11.0
* sqlite3 >= Version 2.6.0
* C compiler (e.g. GCC)
* Fortran compiler (e.g. GFortran)

NanoCap + GUI from source
-------------------------

* Qt - >= Version 4.8.5 
* PySide - >= Version 1.1.1 
* VTK - >= Version 5.8 

OSX
---
Numpy and Scipy can be installed using the python package manager PyPi or easy_install:

pip install numpy
pip install scipy

The easiest way to use PyCan from source on OSX is to install the above libs using Homebrew:

http://www.brew.sh/

The following formula are avaibable:

brew install python --universal
brew install qt --developer -v
brew install pyside
brew install --python --qt vtk

Gfortran is also needed to compile the EDIP extension.

Linux
-----
Numpy and Scipy can be installed using the python package manager PyPi or easy_install:

pip install numpy
pip install scipy

Using packages managers bundled with most linux distributions, the additional libs 
required for the use of the GUI enable NanoCap should be easy to install.


Windows
-------

- From source:

Using PythonXY, https://code.google.com/p/pythonxy/. NanoCap can be used from source on most
windows machines. In addition to PythonXY, PySide is also needed:

	http://qt-project.org/wiki/PySide_Binaries_Windows

PythonXY installs MinGW which includes C and Fortran compilers (GCC and GFortran). These are
used to compile the C and Fortran extensions. To allow the routines to run in parrallel, openmp
is required:

	mingw-get install libgopenmp

After python setup.py install, nanocap will be installed somewhere like this:

	C:\Python27\Lib\site-packages\NanoCap-1.0_alpha-py2.7.egg\nanocap

and can be ran using:

	python C:\Python27\Lib\site-packages\NanoCap-1.0_alpha-py2.7.egg\nanocap\main.py.

Alternatively, the user_scripts can be ran from any location:

	python user_scripts/bulk_capped_nanotubes.py


- Standalone (exe):

User must download and install the Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 Redistributable Package:
